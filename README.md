# Velocity-and-Positioning-Estimation-in-Mobile-Ad-Hoc-Networks


Zhenming Zhang's Final Year Project


Mobile ad hoc network is stepping into our life and occupying a critical position with the escalating desire for free communication whenever and wherever possible. At the same time, the vigorous development of the neural network also brings a new way of thinking to the mobile ad hoc network. Is there a way to apply neural network in MANET? LET, as the most classical prediction model, has been used for years. This model will present you how to use long short-term memory in the recurrent neural network to design a new prediction model in MANET.
